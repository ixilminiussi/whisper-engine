# Goals
With this engine, I hope to learn from the lessons of CMX engine and accomplish a number of things:
1. optimize my use of vulkan bindings (with batching.)
2. improve support for artists by supporting PBR materials, .mtl files, and animations
3. focus on fixing vulkan issues as they happen, even those that only happen upon closing program
4. support better lighting techniques
5. compartimentalize features better
6. Make HUSH on it
